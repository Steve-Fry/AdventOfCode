# AdventOfCode
Using the [2019 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) as an excuse to learn some C# and XUnit. 

# Summary
I'm using this as an oppertunity to start learning some C#, this should sit quite nicely alongside powershell for situations where I need higher performance. 

This isn't pretty, and won't stand up to scrutiny, but is keeping me entertained in when I have some free time.

# Issues
 * IntcodeVM is overcomplicated (but works). 
 * Test coverage is poor (I'm using the tests to build up the solutions and guard against regressions when I refactor). 
 * I have a lot to learn with C#!
